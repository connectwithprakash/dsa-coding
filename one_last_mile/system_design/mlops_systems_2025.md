### Feature Store Implementation
```python
# Feature Store API Design
class FeatureStore:
    def get_online_features(self, feature_names, entity_keys):
        # Serve features with <10ms latency
        pass
    
    def get_offline_features(self, feature_query, timestamp_range):
        # Return training datasets with point-in-time correctness
        pass
    
    def register_feature_view(self, feature_view):
        # Register feature definitions and transformations
        pass
```

**Data Flow**:
1. **Ingestion**: Stream/batch data into feature store
2. **Transformation**: Apply feature engineering logic
3. **Storage**: Dual write to online/offline stores
4. **Serving**: Real-time API for model inference
5. **Monitoring**: Track feature quality and usage

### Model Serving Architecture
```
[Load Balancer] → [API Gateway] → [Model Servers] → [Model Registry]
                                      ↓
[Monitoring] ← [Logging] ← [Inference Cache] ← [Feature Store]
```

**Deployment Strategies**:
- **Blue-Green**: Switch traffic between environments
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with safety checks
- **Shadow**: Run new model alongside production for validation

### Real-Time Processing Pipeline
```
[Event Stream] → [Feature Engineering] → [Model Inference] → [Decision API]
     ↓               ↓                      ↓                    ↓
[Data Lake] → [Feature Store] → [Model Registry] → [Action Service]
```

**Latency Requirements**:
- Feature computation: <10ms
- Model inference: <50ms
- End-to-end decision: <100ms

## 🎯 Interview Preparation Tips

### Common Follow-up Questions
1. "How would you handle model drift in production?"
2. "What happens when your feature store goes down?"
3. "How do you ensure training/serving skew doesn't happen?"
4. "Design the rollback strategy if a model performs poorly"
5. "How would you scale this to 10x traffic?"
